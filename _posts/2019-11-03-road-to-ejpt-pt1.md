A few months ago, I was fortunate enough to have my employer approve my request for the eLearnSecurity Network Pentester training path. The training path consists of a course/certification combo for three different skill levels. They offer a Junior, Professional, and Extreme course with corresponding certification. I'm hoping to get though the eJPT course over the next 3-4 months and take a crack at the certification exam. The certification [page](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ejpt/) has a list of skills it states the student will obtain over the duration of the course, but I'll list them out here just so I can practice how markdown works. :sunglasses:

* Good knowledge of TCP/IP
* Good knowledge of IP routing
* Good knowledge of LAN protocols and devices
* Good knowledge of HTTP and web technologies
* Essential penetration testing processes and methodologies
* Basic Vulnerability Assessment of Networks
* Basic Vulnerability Assessment of Web Applications
* Exploitation with Metasploit
* Simple Web application Manual exploitation
* Basic Information Gathering and Reconnaissance
* Simple Scanning and Profiling the target

Now that I've got a few years of sysadmin experience under my belt along with a few boxes popped on [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu), I feel like most of this should be pretty easy to get through other than the Web App stuff. I feel that WebApp assessment/exploitation is where the biggest gap in my (limited) knowledge is, so I'm looking forward to getting through that material.  

For the course, I'm going to be using a Kali Linux Virtual Machine that I used for [The Cyber Mentor's](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor/) Penetration Testing series he did on Twitch a few months back.  I've added a few things here or there when I've needed them, but I'll try to make sure I reference any new tools I found useful for the different labs or anything like that.  

I'm not sure how much more rambling I can do in an introductory post, but the goal of writing this all out is to help give me some motivation/accountability to keep myself working through this course material so I can hopefully move into a career in Red Teaming/Pentesting/Vulnerability Assessment.  Happy hacking!
